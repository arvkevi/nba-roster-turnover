App: NBA Roster Turnover
Author: [Kevin Arvai](https://github.com/arvkevi))\n
Source: [Github Original](https://github.com/arvkevi/nba-roster-turnover)

Explore NBA roster turnover from year to year and the correlation it has with team wins.

*Roster turnover* is defined as the sum of the total absolute difference between minutes played by each
player from year to year There is a significant negative correlation with higher turnover and
regular season wins.

This was built with Streamlit and originally deployed to heroku.

Ideas for improvements:

- Added summary section on total correlation across all years
- Add something about statistical significance
- Add best fit, linear regression to plot
- Add coloring to the two tables identicating high/ low values
- Get dataframe to be wider
- remove team= from plot
- Maybe show source dataframes somewhere to easier understand what is possible with the data
- Create an animation automatically incrementing the year every 4 seconds or so.
